# Issue Injector

**IssueInjector** is a GitHub Action that excels in turning security findings, especially those in the SARIF (Static Analysis Results Interchange Format), into actionable GitHub Issues. This makes it extremely versatile, compatible with almost any security tool that exports findings in the SARIF format. Acting as a bridge between your security scan outputs and your GitHub Issues tab, it auto-populates issues based on identified vulnerabilities, risks, or areas that need attention. By handling this conversion seamlessly, IssueInjector allows your team to shift their focus from identification to immediate action and resolution. In essence, it's an automated, highly adaptable triage system for your code's security, facilitating quicker fixes and a more secure end product.
